## Hey!

I am a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder (sko buffs) pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with plans of pursuing a M.S. in Data Science starting in January 2024 with an estimated completion date of December 2024. I'm seeking an internship for the upcoming semester that will enable me to develop as a programmer and software engineer.
